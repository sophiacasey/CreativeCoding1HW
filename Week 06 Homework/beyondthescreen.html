        Welcome to Beyond The Screen! This is a safe space where we watch movies and have thorough discussions on how the film impacted us. Kind of like a book club, but for films!
<br />
<h4>How Does This Work?</h4>
        I'll watch a movie every week or so based off of your recommendations. After viewing the film I'll give my personal analysis and thoughts on the film. I do provide a community response section so you can chime in on the conversation!
<br />
<br />            
        Let's watch some films together!
