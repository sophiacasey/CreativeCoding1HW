        <h5>Where do I even begin with this movie? It was everything. I have watched this movie five times now, and every time I watch it I pick up on something new. This film shed light on parent-child relationships (more specifically that of Asian culture), depression caused from unreachable expectations and unaccepting parents, solving problems with love and understanding instead of violence, and so much more.
            <br>
            <br>
            Joy, or 'Jobu Tupaki' is the villain of this movie. Even then, the word villain is used lightly. Joy is not a villain, she is seen as different or as a threat to her mom who is our main protagonist. It could be argued that Joy is actually our protagonist, but we can into that another time. Evelyn sees Joy and her lifestyle as a threat to Evelyn's own relationship with her father, who is a very traditional man. Joy being in a lesbian relationship and losing touch with her Chinese culture is seen by Evelyn as something that needs to be fixed or changed in order to hold onto what little respect her father may have for her. In the end, Evelyn realizes that these things aren't problems. She accepts her daughter for what she is and tells her that no matter what Joy does, Evelyn will always be her mom and will always love her.

            <br>
            This is what Joy has been fighting for, and because she hasn't received that affirmation she decides it's best to disappear and makes it her mission to do just that. In the film's context, if Joy was to go into the bagel the word would be sucked in with it and destroyed. Symbolically, I'll argue that the 'world' would really be that of Evelyn's. If we're speaking realistically, losing one's child is a world-changing event. I imagine it's devastating and that there is no pain quite like it. Evelyn and Waymond's world would be completely turned inside out, just as the bagel would suck the entire world into it's darkness.

            The overall pace of this film felt perfect to me. It was chaotic and hectic and made no sense at times, which is entirely purposeful by the filmmakers in order to show how this entire rift in Evelyn's relationship with her family could have been solved with less chaos, confusion, and miscommunication, if she had approached it with a loving and understanding mind. The character of Waymond embodies this theme, and it becomes aware in countless scenes throughout the movie, but the most notable one is his monologue scene towards the end where he stops Evelyn from fighting with her fists and says, "Can we all please stop fighting?" This speech is what makes Evelyn realize that she's been going about it all in the wrong way. She see's that in order to save her daughter, she needs to show her that she cares and loves her regardless of Joy's lifestyle and whether Evelyn disagrees with it.
