For my final project, I want to create an audio visualizer that is interactive with a  lofi song I am creating for a different course. I want to be able to see the waveform of the song and how it changes based off of the different instruments in the song as well as decible level.

I am inspired by the audio visualizer that was included in the Past Examples page on the course website, as well as the idea of synesthesia (seeing colors in your mind when you listen to music). I do not have synesthesia, but I have always wondered what it would be like to see the song in your head as you listen to it. This is what has mainly inspired me to create an audio visualizer, so that I can see and experience a song that I've made in a different way.

I know that I will need to figure out how to make the waveform visible, as well as how to make it interact with the song in live time. I will also learn how to bed this waveform into any shape I want in order to make this project more visually pleasing. I'm also learning how to create particles and make those another interactive feature with this project as well.

As of the moment I am posting this markdown file, I have already started working on my final project, so I will share the schedule that I have been following so far. Every other day in the week, I have been working on this project for 1hr - 1hr 30min. This way, I can balance this final project with my other classes and not spend too much time/brain energy on one project. 

This schedule has worked great for me, as I am pretty much almost done with my project. All that I have left to do is finish the new song, replace the placeholder song in my project file, and then figure out a way to make the GitHub link work. So far, the main.html page is only showing up with 'loading' text, however, the link that is provided in the preview window of Visual Studio Code works perfectly fine if you bring it into a different browser.

I have contacted Cory and sent him my project to see if we can get the main link to work, so I am just waiting on a response for that. If we can't figure somehting out, I plan on using the preview link that does work as a backup (if that is allowed).
